Task 1: `processArray` function
The `processArray` function takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled. It utilizes the `map` method to iterate over the input array, applying the corresponding transformation based on the number's parity.

Task 2: `formatArrayStrings` function
The `formatArrayStrings` function takes two arrays as input: an array of strings and an array of numbers. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number, capitalizing the string if the number is even and converting it to lowercase if the number is odd. It uses the `map` method and the index parameter to access the corresponding number while iterating over the array of strings.

Task 3: `createUserProfiles` function
The `createUserProfiles` function takes two arrays as input: an array of names and an array of modified names. It creates an array of objects, where each object represents a user profile. Each object contains the original name, modified name, and an auto-incremented id starting from 1. It uses the `map` method to iterate over the array of names and generates the user profiles using the corresponding elements from both arrays.
